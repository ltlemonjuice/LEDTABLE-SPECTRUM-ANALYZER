# LEDTABLE-SPECTRUM-ANALYZER

Spectrum Analyzer for the LEDTABLE Project  

LEDTABLE Project: https://github.com/ltlemonjuice/LEDTABLE  


**Status:** In Progress...


####TODO, CHANGES, IDEAS:
- Microphone Test has successfully been completed  
- Output of the MicTest.py have been converted into VolumeLevels.py which essentially just outputs its output as traversing level bars which looks kinda cool.
- **TODO:**
  - Understand FFT and Numpy
  - Real Spectrum Analyzer
- **Problems:**
  - There seems to be a problem when rearranging the numpy array. Seems to be a internal problem which i can hardly fix. May need thorough investigation to be able to tackle the problem.
